"""Phase 2: Pakistan tax setup automation.

Creates the tax Chart of Accounts entries and the Sales/Purchase Taxes and Charges
Templates for a chosen Company. Triggered from a button on Pakistan Tax Settings,
so it runs against a real Company (with its Chart of Accounts) that the admin picks.

Idempotent: every account/template is skipped if it already exists, so re-running
never duplicates and never overwrites a customer's edits.

Rates are the current defaults (verify against the latest Finance Act / SROs):
federal sales tax on goods 18%, further tax 3%, and sales tax on services by
province (Sindh 13%, Punjab 16%, KP 15%, Balochistan 15%, ICT 15%).
