"""Phase 4: Pakistan withholding-tax (WHT) setup automation.

Creates ERPNext's native **Tax Withholding Category** records for the Pakistani
income-tax sections most relevant to supplier payments, in Filer and Non-Filer
variants (filer = on the FBR Active Taxpayer List, non-filer = not). This reuses
ERPNext's built-in WHT engine (Purchase Invoice `apply_tds`, the supplier's
`tax_withholding_category`, dated rate rows and thresholds) rather than building a
parallel deduction engine, the same "extend the platform" approach used elsewhere
in this app.

Company-scoped like the Phase 2 tax setup: it creates a WHT payable account under
the company's Duties and Taxes group and adds it to each category's accounts table.
Idempotent: existing accounts / categories are skipped.

RATE POLICY (guardrails #1 and #4): the rates below are DEFAULTS that MUST be
verified against the current Finance Act / SROs (Income Tax Ordinance 2001, First
and Tenth Schedules) before production use. They are not baked in as truth: they
live in this editable table and in the created Tax Withholding Categories, both of
which a user can change without touching code. Non-filer rates are listed
explicitly per section (they are NOT uniformly double the filer rate). When a rate
is uncertain, confirm it; do not treat these defaults as authoritative.

# Pakistan withholding income-tax sections most relevant to supplier payments.

# 2026 (updated to 30 June 2025 per the Finance Act 2025), cross-checked against
# KPMG (Taseer Hadi), TAG & Co., A.F. Ferguson/PwC and Grant Thornton. Non-filer =
# filer rate uplifted 100% under the Tenth Schedule (a clean 2x for these sections).
# Where a section splits company vs individual/AOP, the COMPANY rate is used (ERP
# suppliers are usually companies); the non-company variants are noted below.
# Still verify against the live card before production; rates change every Finance Act.

# Per-section caveats:
#   153(1)(a) goods:    5/10 company (5.5/11 individual-AOP). Was 4.5% pre-FA2025.
#   153(1)(b) services: 15/30 is the TY2026 GENERAL rate (FA2025 merged the old
#                       9%/11% company/non-company split). Reduced carve-outs exist:
#                       specified services (transport, courier, manpower, security,
#                       engineering) 6/12; IT & IT-enabled 4/8; media advertising
#                       1.5/3. Pick per supplier's service type. (Note: PwC's live
#                       page shows 7/14 because it has rolled forward to TY2027.)
#   153(1)(c) contracts: 7.5/15 company (8/16 individual-AOP; sportspersons 15/30).
#   233 commission:      12/24 general (advertising agents 10/20; life-insurance 8/16).
#   155 rent:            15/30 flat for a COMPANY payee. Individual/AOP landlords are
#                        SLAB-based (not a flat %), so they need separate handling and
#                        are intentionally not seeded as a flat category here.
